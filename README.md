# Information Retrieval System

This repository contains two Python scripts designed for building an inverted index and executing queries on a collection of text documents.

## Overview

The two scripts serve different purposes:

- `Q1.py`: Tokenizes text documents, removes stop words and punctuation, and saves the processed tokens to output files. This step is crucial for preparing the text data for efficient search and retrieval.
- `Q2.py`: Constructs an inverted index from the output files generated by `Q1.py` and provides functionality to execute Boolean queries, enabling users to retrieve relevant documents based on their search terms and operations.

## Purpose

### Tokenization (Q1.py)

This script preprocesses text data by breaking it down into individual words or tokens, excluding stop words and punctuation. The key functions are:

- `tokenization(x)`: Tokenizes the content of a text file specified by `x`, converts the text to lowercase, removes stop words and punctuation using spaCy, and returns a list of tokens.

The tokenized output is then saved to output files.

### Inverted Index and Query Execution (Q2.py)

This script builds an inverted index from the preprocessed tokens generated by `Q1.py`. An inverted index is a data structure that maps each unique term in the corpus to the documents in which it appears. The key functions are:

- `inv_index()`: Constructs the inverted index by iterating through the output files generated by `Q1.py`, counting term frequencies in each document, and storing the information in a dictionary format.

- `save_index(index, filename='inverted_index.pkl')`: Saves the inverted index to a pickle file for later retrieval.

- `load_index(filename='inverted_index.pkl')`: Loads the inverted index from the pickle file.

- `execute_query(query, inverted_index)`: Executes Boolean queries based on the inverted index. It parses the query, retrieves relevant documents using logical operators (AND, OR, AND NOT, OR NOT), and returns the result set.

## Usage

- **Tokenization (Q1.py):** Users input the filenames of text documents located in the `text_files` directory. The script then tokenizes the content of each document, removes stop words and punctuation, and saves the resulting tokens to output files in the `output` directory.

- **Inverted Index and Query Execution (Q2.py):** Users interactively input queries and corresponding operations (AND, OR, AND NOT, OR NOT). The script retrieves the inverted index generated by `Q1.py`, executes the queries using the index, and displays the relevant documents retrieved based on the search terms and logical operations specified.

## Notes

- **Efficiency:** Both scripts leverage spaCy for efficient text processing and manipulation, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **Flexibility:** Users can customize the scripts to accommodate different types of text data and query requirements.
- **Persistence:** The inverted index is saved and loaded using the pickle module, ensuring data persistence across script executions and enabling fast retrieval of indexed information.

These scripts provide a foundational framework for implementing information retrieval systems and can be extended and adapted to suit various text processing and search applications.
